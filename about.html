<p>Hi there! My name is Breanna Zavadoff and I am an Assistant Scientist at the University of Miami Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS). I currently work with both CIMAS and NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) personnel with the goal of improving sub-seasonal prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and atmospheric rivers using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory SHiELD model.   </p>

<p>I was born and raised on Long Island, New York. Growing up I was always fascinated with the weather, which led me to study Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at Stony Brook University. After undergrad I went directly into graduate school at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science where I pursued a PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography. While there I performed research on European atmospheric rivers and the decadal variability of summertime North Atlantic Rossby wave breaking under Dr. Benjamin Kirtman. Following an 18-month stint at the NWS Weather Prediction Center, I have returned to my University of Miami roots to continue atmospheric science research.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to cook, attend sporting events, and go on walks/adventures with my wife Keeley and dog Finn.</p>
